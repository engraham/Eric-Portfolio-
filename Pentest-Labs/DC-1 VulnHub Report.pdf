# CLIENT PENTEST REPORT â€” DC-1 VulnHub

---

## Executive Summary

This penetration test targeted an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine (DC-1).  
The objective was to demonstrate a complete attack chain:
- Foothold via weak credentials
- Local privilege escalation via kernel exploit
- Lateral pivot (optional)
- Exfiltration of sensitive data

Risk level: **Critical**

---

## Scope

- Target: DC-1 VM (192.168.x.x)
- Methodology: Recon â†’ Exploit â†’ Post-Ex â†’ Reporting
- Duration: [Date]

---

## Methodology

1. Reconnaissance (Nmap, enumeration)
2. Exploitation (public exploit)
3. Privilege escalation (local enumeration, exploit)
4. Post-Exploitation (proof, data exfil)

---

## Findings

| ID | Vulnerability | Risk | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----|----------------|------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | SSH weak creds | High | `ssh root@target` with default creds | Enforce strong passwords, disable root SSH |
| 2 | Kernel privesc | Critical | `uname -a`, exploited CVE-xxxx | Apply latest kernel patches |
| 3 | Sensitive data exfil | Critical | `cat /etc/passwd` | Use file permissions, monitor for exfil |

---

## Risk Rating Matrix

| Risk | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Critical | Immediate exploit, total compromise |
| High | Major impact, exploitable with effort |
| Medium | Moderate impact, limited exploitability |
| Low | Minor, informational only |

---

## Remediation Plan

1. Update system packages & kernel:  
   ```bash
   apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
````

2. Enforce SSH key auth & disable root login:

   ```bash
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```
3. Review user accounts & permissions.

---

## Conclusion

The vulnerabilities demonstrate a complete kill chain from foothold to root compromise.
Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent real-world exploitation.
