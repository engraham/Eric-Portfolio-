# 🕵️ Eric Graham | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
I’m **Eric Graham**, a hands-on **Junior Penetration Tester** and **Application Security learner** actively building my skills in offensive security and secure development practices.

This repository is my **public portfolio** of self-directed labs and practical write-ups — demonstrating my ability to identify, exploit, document, and remediate real-world security vulnerabilities in a *controlled*, *ethical* lab environment.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

This repo contains **two main sections**:

### 🚩 Penetration Testing Labs

Practical exploit walkthroughs targeting intentionally vulnerable systems such as:
- **Metasploitable2**
- **OWASP Broken Web Applications (BWA)**
- Other CTFs and custom targets

Each lab includes:
- Reconnaissance steps  
- Exploitation methodology  
- Evidence (commands, output, screenshots)  
- Impact & risk explanation  
- Remediation suggestions

### 🔐 Application Security Labs

Focused on:
- Common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Source code review examples
- Secure coding best practices
- Static & dynamic analysis examples
- Threat modeling exercises

Each lab demonstrates how I identify, analyze, and remediate web app weaknesses.

## ⚙️ Tools & Skills Used

Throughout these labs, I use:
- **Kali Linux**
- **Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto**
- **Metasploit**
- **Burp Suite**
- **OWASP ZAP**
- Manual testing techniques
- Secure coding principles

## ✅ Purpose & Goals

This portfolio:
- 📚 *Proves my practical, hands-on skills*
- 💼 *Supports my applications for junior Pentest / AppSec roles*
- 🌐 *Shows I can communicate technical findings clearly*
- 🕵️ *Demonstrates ethical hacking practices*

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer

All tests were conducted **only** against systems designed to be vulnerable (Metasploitable2, OWASP BWA, CTF VMs) in **isolated lab environments**.  
No unauthorized testing or exploitation was performed.  
This repository is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.
