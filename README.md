# 🕵️‍♂️ Eric Graham | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
I’m **Eric Graham**, a dedicated **Junior Penetration Tester** and **Application Security practitioner** committed to offensive security and secure development best practices.

This repository is my **public portfolio** of **hands-on labs**, practical **exploit walkthroughs**, and **realistic reports** — all demonstrating my ability to identify, exploit, document, and recommend remediation for real-world vulnerabilities in a **controlled**, **ethical**, and **self-directed lab environment**.

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

This portfolio includes **two main sections**:

### 🚩 Penetration Testing Labs

Practical exploit chains targeting intentionally vulnerable systems and CTF-style environments:
- **Lab 1:** Metasploitable2 — classic network vulnerabilities (vsftpd backdoor, Samba RCE)
- **Lab 2:** VulnHub (DC: 1 or equivalent) — initial foothold → privilege escalation → pivot → exfiltration chain, with risk matrix & MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Real screenshots & commands
- Impact explanation and realistic mitigations

---

### 🔐 Application Security Labs

Focused on real-world web application testing:
- **Lab 3:** OWASP BWA or DVWA — classic web attacks (XSS, CSRF, file upload → RCE)
- **Lab 4:** Modern web chain — JWT attacks, insecure API endpoints, auth bypass examples
- Secure coding recommendations
- Source code review snippets
- Static & dynamic analysis methodology

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Skills Highlighted

These labs demonstrate my comfort with:
- **Kali Linux & offensive security toolsets**
- **Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto, Hydra**
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Burp Suite & OWASP ZAP**
- **Manual testing & custom scripts**
- **Privilege escalation & post-exploitation**
- **Risk assessment & mitigation writing**

---

## 📑 Real Reporting

Each lab includes:
- Clear **methodology & tactics**
- **Step-by-step walkthroughs**
- **Screenshots and evidence**
- **Executive Summaries** for non-technical stakeholders
- **Risk Rating Matrix** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Actionable Mitigations** with commands or config guidance
- MITRE **ATT&CK mapping** where relevant

Where appropriate, I include **PDF deliverable samples** to demonstrate how I communicate findings to clients.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

This portfolio:
- ✅ *Proves my hands-on practical skillset*
- ✅ *Supports my applications for junior pentest & AppSec roles*
- ✅ *Shows I can communicate risk & remediation clearly*
- ✅ *Demonstrates ethical hacking best practices*

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer

All tests documented here were conducted **only** on intentionally vulnerable systems (Metasploitable2, VulnHub, OWASP BWA) in **isolated lab environments**.  
No unauthorized testing or exploitation was performed.  
This content is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.
